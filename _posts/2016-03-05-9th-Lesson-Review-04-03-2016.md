**9th Lesson Review 04-03-2016**

**Summary:** This lesson was fun because we got to watch a video about other people just having some fun. However this turns well to serious and they got into severe trouble and their lives were ruined. This taught us a good lesson that a bit of fun is good but do not let it get out of hand, especially when using social media. It was also interesting to see my classmates opinion about the decisions in the videos. 

**Positive Points:** I thought that I made the right decisions and would not have suffered from any consequences**.**

**Negative Points:** I contributed to the lesson and we did not use the computers so there is not much I can improve on.

**Ways to Improve:** Carry on putting my hand up and completing the homework on time.
