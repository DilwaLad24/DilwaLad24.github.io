**8th Lesson Review 10/11/2016 - Improving our blog**

I have changed the layout because this was not a regular lesson and we did not use our fuse boxes. This week was all about improving our blogs.

**Summary:** Today Mr Keen showed us how he graded our blogs. He showed us some examples which were good and bad: he explained what mark he would give them and why. Mr Tansley also gave us advice and he showed us his website which was very helpful. 

**What I learned:** I now know what aspects of my blog need to be changed, for example my table layout needs to be adjusted. I also know how to improve my blog like adding shadows. In addition I need to write with more quality and increase the quantity but keep my writing at a high standard.
