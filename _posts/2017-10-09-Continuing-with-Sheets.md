    <td>Today we were learning about finished looking at the delivery cost, which varied because of the price. Once we had finished that we focused on the voucher codes and we created a stock list of applicable voucher codes so that people could not cheat us. Before any code with a the correct 2 letters could work however now there is a list of applicable codes which the computer checks before submitting the code. Mr Keen did a lot of work about perseverance and not being given the answer. He never makes the lesson easy for us and he does not allow us of anyone else to give another the answer. If you are stuck you should do something about it before asking him. This is now drilled into me.</td>
