**First Lesson Review**

Positive Points: This lesson was very exciting. Making my own website is something my dad nor I had ever done. I was very happy with my speed of progress & my finished product. Also Mr Keen was in a good, kind mood. This is not something you see very often so I have treasured the memory. 

Negative Points: In this lesson I could have improved. I did not know what was next before he had explained it. This needs to be improved if I want to be top of the class.

Ways to improve: I need to engage my brain quicker because in the first couple of tasks I was slow. Also I need to think twice before asking a question to make sure it is not stupid.
