**12th Lesson Review 22-04-2016**

**Summary:** Today we looked at coding a microbit. This is really exciting considering everyone around the world is doing it. Also I was watching BBC One and I saw an advert for this. Before this lesson I thought that coding was impossible but actually it is quite easy. At first I struggled but through a bit of perseverance I got better.

**What I learned:**  Because there is not much I can judge myself on I am going to say what I learnt. I learned that you have to look at a problem from a different angle if you are stuck.
