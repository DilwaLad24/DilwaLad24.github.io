    <td>Today was the final lesson of the half term so we were rounding off all the work we have already done. We added another sheet called P&L which helped us figure out if the company was making a profit. Also we made sure we had completed all the work we had already been given. We reused the VLOOKUP formulae lots and we also reused the function SUM. I did take a more active approach when Mr Keen was talking to the class and sitting at the front helped me. I am also glad that the spreadsheet was embed at the end of the last blog. During this lesson I stuck my head down and did lots of work which meant that I only have to do this blog for homework. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to increase my learning by looking answers up before going straight to Mr Keen or a friend. Also if I look answers up I am more likely to get the correct answer and expand my learning. This will help me get better grades and increase my knowledge. Additionally, Mr Keen talked about GCSEs and the Computer Science GCSE. I am unsure of the GCSEs I want to do at the moment but, if I can impress, I might want to take Computer Science</td>

  <tr>
    <td>After half term I should be refreshed after the break and I need to continue working hard like this half term. As I said I need to look up answers when I do not know them which will help expand my learning. I have learned a lot over this half term and I know I will need to use Sheets in the future. </td>
