** 21st Lesson Review 15/07/2016**

**Summary:** In our final IT lesson of the year Mr Keen talked to us about propaganda. I already knew a bit about this topic but Mr Keen definitely increased my knowledge of propaganda. He gave us examples of where propaganda is used such as a deodorant ad which had Lewis Hamilton in it. People think that if they use that deodorant they will be good at formula 1, which is not true. 

**What I learned:** I learned techniques of propaganda and I learned that propaganda is all around us.

**What I could have improved on:** Because I had a bit of knowledge about propaganda I should have shared it with the class.
