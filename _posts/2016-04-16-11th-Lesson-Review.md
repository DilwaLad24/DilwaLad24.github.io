**11th Lesson Review 15-04-16**

**Summary:** During this lesson we focused on the Easter Holidays homework which was to do a Prezi on the History of Computers. Before this task I did not know much about it so this homework was helpful. I thought I did OK but there are still things I need to change before next week. Mr Keen judges us on lots of criteria such as missed capital letters, wrong grammar, no big blocks of text and using bullet points, but mainly no silly mistakes. He does not accept us being the tiniest bit lazy. I am glad I have Mr Keen as a teacher because he is one of the only teachers who are firm, fair and funny.

There is not much I can judge myself on because we mainly looked and listened rather than answering questions.
