    <td>At the start of the lesson I was a little bit worried because I had never used codecademy before and I was not sure what to do. However once Mr Keen explained what it was I felt better. My confidence grew throughout the lesson and I completed the stages with speed. Most of the first exercises were quite simple which also helped. I made sure I read the the instructions thoroughly and I never had to use the hint.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>With Codecademy you have to make sure you do not make any silly mistakes typing otherwise the code does not work. This troubled me at the start however after a while I improved. Also during the lesson my fellow classmate was stuck on an exercise; instead of being quiet or asking if he had read the instructions I told him the answer. This was the wrong thing to do I did not help his learning.

    <td>As the first lesson of Codecademy I was quite proud of my progress however I need to stop making typing errors and I my pier is having problems with a certain stage I cannot tell him the answer. Instead I can be quiet, see if he has read the instructions or I can tell him to read the tip. </td>
