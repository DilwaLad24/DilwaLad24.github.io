    <td>This lesson was quite hard because the harder the level the harder the exercises become. However I think I worked well and coped with challenge which is a key Challoner's motto.  There were very few typing errors but it took me too long to think of the answers. I made sure I read all of the explanations so that when I start the task it is easier to complete. I did not waste valuable time getting distracted by others, which was my target from last week.

  <tr>
    <td>Because the tasks got harder I had to ask Mr Tansley for help to complete a task. I should have used other resources first such as the hint or even a peer before I went straight to the teacher. I need to use the teacher less and spend more time on the question myself. This will improve my Python coding and improve my knowledge of Codecademy.

  <tr>
    <td>I will learn to use other resources before I use the teacher and I will keep on working quickly and efficiently. This was the last IT lesson this half term because next week is Activites week and the week after that is half term. I am proud of my progress this half term and I will work even harder next term.</td>
