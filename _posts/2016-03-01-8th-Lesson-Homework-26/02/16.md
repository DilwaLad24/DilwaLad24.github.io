**8th Lesson Homework 26/02/16**

**I was not in this lesson because I was playing in a  hockey tournament but I am answering all the questions I am able to.**

* Creating my mind-map was exciting because I never realised all the different things I do in my life which most people would not do. However, it was also a challenge to explain everything I have done clearly.

* In the future I will use more social media mainly for fun but I will make sure it is not a massive distraction from my goals. I do not use any social media at the moment. 

* I do not use any social media at the moment so I cannot have any regrets.

* Yes these six lessons did change how I view social media because now I understand how dangerous it is and how you can get addicted to it. Before these six lessons I always thought social was only banter and fun but now I know it has side-effects.

* These lessons did not majorly change my mind about how I plan to use social media in the future  however now I am wary of some of the consequences if I post something which could be taken offensively.
