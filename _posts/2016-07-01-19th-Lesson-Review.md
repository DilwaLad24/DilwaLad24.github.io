**19th Lesson Review 30-06-16**

**Summary:** Today we got our Microbit's. I am very happy they arrived and I am sure Mr Keen was to because he ordered them at the start of Year 7. I am also excited about our new topic, Social Media. We worked in groups to figure out the uses and what we were afraid of. I am pleased that Mr Keen talks to us about the stuff other teachers do not talk to us about.

**What I learned:** I learned how to connect and compile microbit coding to the microbit. I also learned some 'dirty' details.
