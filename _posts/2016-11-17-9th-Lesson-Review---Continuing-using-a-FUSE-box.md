    <td>This was a very good week for me and my partner even though it got off to a slow start. The main reason we did well is because we worked together and did not argue. For this exercise we needed different equipment and we set it up very quickly: even though I struggled to find it. After that we worked at a steady rate to make sure we read the exercises well and did not make many silly mistakes. I am pleased with this lessons progress.</td>

    <td>The lesson go off to a slow start because I did not read the label that said where the equipment was and when I found it I could not open the box. After that I improved, I tried to make up for it by helping others put away their equipment and moving the boxes at the end of the lesson.</td>
