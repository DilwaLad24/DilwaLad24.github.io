**3rd Lesson Review**

**Lesson**

Summary: This lesson was less exciting than others, however I learned a lot more in this lesson than others. Media is something I have never thoroughly thought about and I have always taken it for granted. Also, the new KIA Soul advert is hilarious but unfortunately I could not persuade my dad to by the car. 

Positive Points: I listened and contributed to the lesson well and made sure I did not start my answer with "Um" or “Like uh like”. This was one of my ways to improve in the first lesson so I am happy about that.

Negative Points: There are not many negative remarks I can make because we did not do any work on the computer.

Ways to improve: I think the only thing to improve is that I need to contribute to the lesson more.
