    <td>Today we were learning about the costs of a business. At the start of the lesson we listed all the costs of the company for example: tax, payrollâ€¦ Then we worked on figuring out the wages and the annual salary. The amount in the salary depended on the hours they worked and their wage. Then we focused on our blog and making sure it is up to date. Also Mr Keen has shown us how to add a spreadsheet into our blog and hopefully it should appear at the of the blog. I was very happy because I worked on my target from last lesson and I did not make the same mistake again. I am also glad because my blog is relatively up to date compared to some others in our group so I do not have lots of blogs to do.</td>

    <td>I need to improve on taking a more active approach in the class. When we were at the from Mr Keen asked a lot of questions and I did not get a chance to answer because I was not sure. I think I need to improve on expanding my knowledge because I noticed that the answers were only given by a few boys not all. I am glad I am not the only one however I still need to improve.  </td>
