    <td>To have a Github Pages Static Website and to start working on the first activity</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Partly. I have a working website and we have started on the first activity but we did not make quick progress.</td>

    <td>Me and my partner Aidan set everything up quite quickly because we worked as a team; helping each other and doing tasks efficiently. But then we started arguing and not believing in each other. I think we both need to trust each other's ability more.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>When we got stuck we tried again but we still did the same thing, like it was magically going to change. It took a long time for us to realise what we were doing wrong even though it was obvious what we were doing wrong. I need to start thinking of other possibilities rather than keep on doing the same thing over and over again. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will try and work better with my partner and I need to see the obvious things quicker while still thing outside the box. Overall during this lesson I do not think I performed badly but it can definitely be improved.</td>
