**Lesson 3 of Year 9 - Continuing to use Sheets 25/09/2017**

**Summary of the lesson:** This lesson we continued to use Google Sheets with Mr Keen. During this lesson we created a complex order form. We created a subtotal and then subtracted the VAT, delivery cost and a voucher. Even the delivery cost was based on the amount you have spent. Mr Keen helped us massively with this however I did the delivery formula based on the knowledge he had given us. Mr Keen also created a new phrase for any lazy questions: "Would you like fries with that?" His sarcastic sense of humour makes the lesson more enjoyable and also motivates us not to get laughed at!

**What I learned:** During this lesson I learned a lot more about how Sheets is coded and converting my knowledge of coding into Sheets. For example we used "if" and “else if” for the delivery and voucher formulae. He also helped me understand more of the VLOOKUP formula.
