    <td>This was a different type of lesson because we finished exercise 2.1 but to complete the next exercise, 4.1, we had to use different equipment which took up time. Also me and Aidan both did tasks separately because we both needed help with our blog, so while one of us was working the other was getting help with our blog. I am very grateful Mr Keen took time out to help us and now my blog is working.   </td>
