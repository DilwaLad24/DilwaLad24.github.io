**14th Lesson Review 05-05-2016**

**Summary:** Today we did a series of tutorials on Microbit to help our understanding of its coding. Mr Keen also made us do an extension which was not on the tutorial so that this was not to easy. We were made to think because the tutorials were not that simple and the outcome was good.

**What I learned:** I learned how hard coding can be because if we did not have the tutorials I probably would never have got t the right outcome.

**What I could change:** I wish I could have been more ambitious and more self-reliant because at times I had to have others help me.
