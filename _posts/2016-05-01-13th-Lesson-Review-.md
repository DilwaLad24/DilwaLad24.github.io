**13th Lesson Review 30-04-2016**

**Summary:** Today we coded a sorting hat, from Harry Potter. The sorting hat chooses which house people are in by reading their thoughts. However when we coded it we instructed it to pick a house at random. For homework we changed the script to Java Script. This was a challenging task, which pushed me to the limit. I enjoyed writing script into something in real life. 

**What I learned:** I learned that computers need an input and an output to do the stuff in the middle.
