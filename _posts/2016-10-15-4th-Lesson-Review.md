**4th Lesson Review 29-09-2016**

I have used a different layout this week because we did not use the fuze's so I could not comment on what I did well and what I need to improve on. 

**Summary:** This week was completely different to previous weeks because we did not use the fuze's. Instead we focused on improving our blogs and making them more interesting. Mr Keen showed us how to add a table and he told us to change our background to an image. I hope I absorbed all the information and my blog should change in the next weeks.
