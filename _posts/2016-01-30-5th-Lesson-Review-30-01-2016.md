**5th Lesson Review 30-01-2016**

**Summary:** This lesson he started off the lesson by explaining the different ways you could have done last week's homework. Then we listed the advantages and disadvantages of media. I have sympathy for one of my classmates Purple Guy who had his hand up for a long and then said a point that was daft. Purple Guy made the lesson more interesting and fun.

**Positive Points:** I contributed to the lesson a lot more and did not use "um" or “like” to start my answer. In my opinion this was one of my best lessons that is why there are no negative points

**Negative Points:** None 

**Improvements:** Keep on working like this.
