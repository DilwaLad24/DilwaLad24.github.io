**Second Lesson Review**

**Summary:**In this lesson we aimed to stop all the errors in our websites and I think we succeeded. We also made our websites more individual by adding colour to it.

**Positive Points:** I really enjoyed this lesson because we had to make our own decisions. I enjoyed adding more excitement to our websites because there is no wrong answer so you can be as creative as you like. 

 

**Negative Points:** This week I do not think there are any negative remarks.

**Improvements:** I think there are no improvements so I should just carry on working hard.
