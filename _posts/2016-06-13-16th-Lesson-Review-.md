**16th Lesson Review 10-06-2016**

**Summary:** Today we did an anonymous survey on the computing devices and how we use them at home. This was completely separate to our regular classwork and I answered as honestly as I could do. We then looked at flowcharts and creating a microbit. I am working with [http://navlad247.github.io/](http://navlad247.github.io/) and I hope we can make a good game.

**What I learned:** I learned about flowcharts and how they work. I also learned how to use lucidchart.

**What I could have improved on:** I could have answered more questions and be more charp doing the survey.
