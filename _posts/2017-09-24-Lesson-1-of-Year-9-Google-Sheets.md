**Lesson 1 of Year 9 11/9/17**

**Summary of lesson:** This lesson was the first of year 9 and I was very excited to learn more. Our topic for the next few weeks is Google Sheets. I am very happy to be learning about Sheets because I have never been taught this. We started off learning about different functions of sheets and how to use them. For example we learned about Product, Sum and Average.We also created stock lists. Finally, we learned about the VLOOKUP function which I found the most challenging.

**What I learned:** Because I have never learned about Sheets before I learned a lot. All the functions were new to me and I, at first, struggled with the VLOOKUP formulae. However, I persevered and I think I understand it now.

**Final notes:** I am very happy with the amount I learned and I behaved well. I am very excited for the next few weeks and I am really enjoying this topic so far.
