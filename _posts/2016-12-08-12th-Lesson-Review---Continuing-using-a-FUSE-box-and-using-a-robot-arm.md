    <td>This lesson my partner Aidan was at a rugby match for most of the lesson so I worked by myself. This was a good challenge because I sometimes rely on him to much. But I think I succeeded because I did not make any typing mistakes and I fully understood the code I was typing. Also when I was using the robot arm I did not "break" it unlike others. It helped that I knew that if you press the up arrow the FUSE repeats the last line. I managed to make the arm pick up a pencil, rotate its shoulder and make it put the pencil down.</td>

    <td>I was slow packing up at the end without my partner and I could not help others. I realise I need to get the robot arm into a sensible position so that it is not that much of a hassle putting it away.

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to use this lesson as a learning experience on not relying on my partner to do most of the work and take control. I thought I understood why things on the robot arm were happening and how to stop it. I also need not to use the on and off switch to stop things happening and use the code.</td>
