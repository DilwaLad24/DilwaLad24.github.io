**20th Lesson Review 07-07-2016**

**Summary:** Today was our penultimate lesson and Mr Keen talked to us about porngraphy and sexting. He talked very straight and told us the truth which definitely helped. I was surprised about his daughter and that he told us that story but it really made me aware that this is a problem everyone my age faces. Then he gave us 3 big points on why not to sext which were all valid points. I feel bad for the new person in our class because this was his first lesson: he must be quite disturbed.  

**What I learned:** I learned how big this problem is for teenagers and I now know who to come to when things go wrong.
