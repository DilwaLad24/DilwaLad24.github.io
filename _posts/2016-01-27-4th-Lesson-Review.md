**4th Lesson Review**

This week our homework was very much like last week's but he added a new challenge: changing a PDF into something I could use. I changed it into a Google Docs page which I could edit. I found this different to most tasks because teachers usually do that for us. I like that Mr Keen added a different ingredient to the recipe this week to make our minds think. I did the Just Eat advert "I need a balti" because it has a mixture of reality and fantasy. 

One of my first posts stated that Mr Keen is not usually in a kind, jolly mood. My opinion has definitely changed over the last couple of weeks because he is now funny, jolly but still firm.
