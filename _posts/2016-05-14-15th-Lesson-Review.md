**15th Lesson Review 13-05-2016**

**Summary:** Today we continued doing the tutorials. They started getting a lot harder as we went through. I found this task quite challenging. It did not help that I lost half of my code at the end.

**What I learned:** I learned the reason we use certain coding in certain places.

**What I could have changed:** I could have worked a bit quicker so there was less homework.
