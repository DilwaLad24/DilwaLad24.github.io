    <td>This lesson I was mainly focused on not missing punctuation which I succeeded in doing. This meant that I worked quicker and achieved my target for the lesson. Also we did not need an introduction to Codecademy like last week which helped me reach my target. Last week I felt worried about starting Codecademy however now I am very comfortable working with it and I am starting to enjoy it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I still need to remember not to be sloppy with my typing especially looking out for typing errors and missing capital letters. This can lead to less work being completed. Also I cannot get distracted by others members of the class messing around because that will lead to me completing less work in the lesson. This means that I will fall behind in the h=work leaving me with more to do next lesson.
