    <td> Me and my partner Aidan did not work very well today and that was mainly my fault. We did tasks separately and that decreased the amount of work we could have done. However at the end we worked together and that is when we got the bulk of our work done.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> For most of the lesson we worked separately so the tasks were not getting done efficiently. We need to work together so that we learn from each other instead of just taking turns.  </td>
