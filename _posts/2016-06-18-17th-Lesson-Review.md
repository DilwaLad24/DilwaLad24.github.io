**17th Lesson Review 16-06-2016**

**Summary:** Today we started doing our games. I was excited but a bit annoyed I did less of the work than Mr Buttlar however I am proud of the progress we made during the lesson. I am excited with the potential of our game.

**What I learned:** To be totally honest I did not learn much because most of the time Mr Keen was getting annoyed at people for not putting effort in. I find this annoying because it wastes people's time, for example me.

**What I could have improved on:** I could have done more work with my partner.
