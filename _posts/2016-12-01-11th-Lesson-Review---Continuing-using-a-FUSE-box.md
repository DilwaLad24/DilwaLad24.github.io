(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, we got onto the robot arm and we are a couple of pages away from finishing the book. I definitely worked  faster and maintained my accuracy but that was helped because we also had Tom W in our group.</td>

    <td>This lesson Tom was working with us because his partner Rowan was not here and this helped us because we had more people. More people helps because we got get more jobs done quicker. While Aidan put wires in the breadboard I typed and to read out the words to me so that I could type quicker. This strategy was very effective. Then with the robot arm we used the same formula. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The problem was more people came with a little bit more arguing about who does what job. Once we agreed that we worked well but next time we need to agree our roles quicker. Also with the robot arm we did not have that much time left so we argued about who got to type the code. We all gotta go in the end but we wasted a bit of time disputing.

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning next time I need to stop arguing and immediately decide our roles. This will increase the amount of work we get done and it will make us feel better. Next lesson if we do this we should be able to finish the book and have time to explore with the robot arm. I am very pleased with this week's amount of work.</td>
