**4th Lesson Review**

**Summary:** This lesson was very different to our other lessons. Mr Keen asked us a lot of questions and I got to learn more about my fellow classmates. In the last few lessons we have not used the computers however they have been extremely valuable.

**Positive points:** I answered all the questions honestly even if I was the only one who said that answer.

**Negative points:** I should have contributed to the lesson more by sticking my hand up.

**Ways to improve:** Contribute to the lesson more often.
