**6th Lesson Review 05/02/2016**

**Summary:** To start off we marked other people's homework. I was quite happy with the amount I typed compared to everyone else and I was extremely pleased with the grade I got given by my fellow classmates. Next we answered the homework and Mr Keen gave his reasons. It is interesting to see a teacher's opinion because it is not usually something we get to hear. After that we watched a very annoying Twitter Song about why you should use Twitter. Some of the reasons were quite sarcastic and all the female characters looked like princesses from Disney movies. This is why we think it was done by Disney. This song was very annoying and is stuck in my head now.

**Positive Points:** I got a good grade in the homework and I answered a couple of questions.

**Negative Points:** I shouted out to much, which annoys Mr Keen a lot.

**Ways to Improve: **Stop shouting out.
