    <td>This was probably the best lesson me and my partner have had this year because we collaborated all lesson and worked to our strengths. So while I was typing the code in he was putting the wires into the Fuse box. I made sure I did type any code wrong by checking it and reading it over again. I know this sounds simple but it helped a lot. We set up very quickly to maximise the work we got done so I did last weeks target of turning on from the beginning. This should be my aim every lesson. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I feel that I could have worked a bit quicker. This week I was very accurate but slow whereas my aim is to be very accurate and quick. However if I increase my speed I need to make sure I keep my accuracy high. Also during one stage the screen just had a number 0 on it so me and Aidan thought something was wrong when actually that was what was meant to happen. If we had just read the text underneath we could have moved on to the next exercise quicker and maybe finished exercise 4.2</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning next time I will try and work faster but maintain my accuracy. Also I will read all the text on the page not just the text which I need to type. This will increase my knowledge of what the code actually means, especially since there is a test coming up. Otherwise I should aim for all lessons to be like this one.</td>
