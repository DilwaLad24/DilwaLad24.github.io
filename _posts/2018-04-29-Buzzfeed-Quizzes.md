    <td>Today we started to create buzzfeed quizzes which is very enjoyable for me because my cousin does these quizzes lots and I have always wondered what is is like to create one. My quiz is based on creating your perfect holiday by asking questions which I use to figure out what time of person you are. I have to find out whether you enjoy exciting, active holidays or relaxing holiday spending most of your time in a spa. At the end of the lesson we got to do other buzzfeed's which helped me understand more about the structure of this type of quiz. I am glad we got to do that at the end of a lesson</td>

    <td>I forgot that you need to order your potential answers in a scale so that you can create an average which actually is meaningful. At the start my 3rd answer was spa and my 4th was ziplane which are 2 completely different answers but the number only changes by 1. Spa should be the 1st answer and zipline as the 4th so that the difference between the numbers 3. This changes the average by a lot more so that you can get different answers. I would have got more progress done if I realised that at the start of the lesson </td>
