    <td> Me and my partner made very good progress and we worked well as a team. We completed exercises at a swift pace because we read through the instructions carefully and we only made a few stupid mistakes. </td>

  <tr>
    <td> We still made a few silly mistakes. We have cut down on them since last week but we still have not got perfection. We also forgot our USB disk so our progress will not be saved. Apart from this little things I think this was a good lesson. </td>
